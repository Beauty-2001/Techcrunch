Pinterest is combining Pins and Idea Pins into a single format

As Pinterest further shifts its focus to video content following the development of its video-focused Idea Pins, the company says it will now streamline its tools for all Pin formats into one creation flow. That means both video Pins and static images, along with other editing features like stickers and overlay text will now be available from one, updated experience. In addition to these changes, Pinterest is also rolling out a series of new editing features, measurement tools, safety features, and other engagement tools.

To create a video or image Pin going forward, users will just select the “create a Pin” option. The company notes that all content creators will be able to include features like music, text overlay, and stickers to their Pins.

Pinterest says that these changes will make it easier for creators to edit, publish and measure their content, while advertisers will still be able to create Idea Ads, Video Ads, Collection Ads, and Carousel Ads as before.

As a result of these changes, Pinterest users will now be able to access features that were previously only available with Idea Pins or users with a business account, including links, post-publish editing, and flexible aspect ratios. All Pins will include the ability to link to anywhere, which Pinterest says will allow users to monetize their content and further engage their audience.

“We’re excited to unlock another monetization channel through links in all Pins,” the company wrote in a blog post. “Users will be able to add links to all images, videos, and even Pinterest TV livestream, helping drive traffic and make connections with brands. The paid partnership tool and product tagging using affiliate links (for the US and the UK) are now available to everyone as additional channels to make money on Pinterest.”

All video Pins will now also have enhanced metrics, including views and watch time. Users will be able to create Pins using flexible aspect ratios and edit Pin components after publishing including the title, details, and links. This puts Pinterest more on par with rival platforms like Instagram, where select content can be edited post-publication, allowing creators to correct or tweak the text for better performance, for example.

As part of these changes, users will no longer have to tap through multimedia creations with static images and videos. Now, this type of content will automatically play one after another.

Pinterest also announced that all users will be able to start accessing a handful of community engagement features. Users can now add keywords they don’t want to see in comments. Users can create a filter under social permissions in order to auto-hide all comments containing the specific keyword. And users will also be able to respond to content on the platform by creating and uploading a photo. Plus, reactions like heart and lightbulb emojis will be expanding to all Pins.

A new Pin scheduling API will also be available to those using content marketing platforms and creative tools, allowing users to schedule Pins via those platforms.

When Pinterest first introduced Idea Pins in 2021, it seemed that the company was looking to pivot from being an online image board to being more of a creator platform. With these changes, Pinterest is looking to streamline its content creation process under a unified format.

“By creating a simpler, faster way for content creators to harness the power of Pinterest, we are making it easier than ever for our creators to reach an engaged audience, make money, build a brand and express what makes them uniquely special both on and off the platform,” said Pinterest Chief Content Officer Malik Ducard in a statement about the changes.

Capchase gets into buy now, pay later with Capchase Pay for SaaS financing

Capchase, a provider of non-dilutive growth capital, is now in the buy now, pay later space after launching Capchase Pay to help Software-as-a-Service companies close deals faster.

Capchase Pay enables SaaS companies to collect the full contract value for their software while also providing their customers with flexible payment terms.

Though SaaS growth didn’t take as big of a hit as previously thought, Miguel Fernandez, co-founder and CEO of Capchase, told TechCrunch that SaaS companies did see a shift in their return on investment when sales cycles delayed as buyer’s asked for more flexible financing terms.

He called buy now, pay later offerings “one of the last B2B payment frontiers to be done in software.” Enterprise companies like Microsoft, SAP, Salesforce and Oracle are able to bring their own financing solutions to the table to help conversion, but it’s still a nascent area for mid-market companies.

Those SaaS companies end up offering big discounts for upfront payments, which turn out to hurt revenue and impact retention after the first year when discounts aren’t expanded, Fernandez said. Capchase’s spoke to SaaS customers and found over 50% of them experienced an increase in sales cycle length and in customer payment delays, and almost 40% of companies increased their collection times as a result.

“We thought it was a perfect time to bring a product to market and accelerate conversion,” he said. “Vendors get all the cash upfront so they can continue to run the business and buyers can get flexibility in payments.”

Capchase Pay prepares quotes automatically and offers flexible payment options across bank accounts and credit cards. More than 20 SaaS companies signed on to use the product in the beta release with Capchase reporting these early customers experienced a 300% increase in sales velocity, an 80% increase in lifetime value and a 20% annual contract value increase.

One of them, CIENCE, a lead generation company, said that within one month of using Capchase Pay, it was closing deals in half the time and grew its “pipeline from low, single-digit prospects for 12-month SaaS contracts to 50 with an average deal size of $100,000,” said August Keating, COO of CIENCE, in a written statement.

Fernandez said that offering a buy now, pay later product has also expanded Capchase’s user base. There was a typical cutoff for revenue-based financing customers having less than $30 million in annual recurring revenue. However, some of its early BNPL customers have hundreds of millions in ARR, he said.

AudiencePlus wants to help every company run its own media platform

It used to be that having a corporate blog and some paid content was the gist of your marketing department’s content efforts, and that was enough. But as larger companies like Salesforce and HubSpot have launched their own full-blown media arms, it may be time to rethink your content strategy.

AudiencePlus, a new media platform from a long-time marketing executive, wants to put the media capabilities of these larger companies within reach of much smaller companies. Today the company announced a $5.4 million seed investment.

“We’re referring to it as an owned media platform, but think of it as an evolution of the blog or the resource center, or maybe it’s a standalone media property for a brand,” company founder and CEO Anthony Kennada told TechCrunch.

The idea is to give you control over your own user base, which is a big reason that HubSpot bought The Hustle, for instance. They wanted to have access to an audience of engaged users, who were interested in what Hubspot is selling.

Kennada is hoping his platform will give that same kind of reach to every company. This involves four main pieces. For starters, you can build a media platform with AudiencePlus without writing any code. This could involve producing videos, podcasts, blogs and even live events.

“So it could be a webinar or a virtual event or something to that end, all on your own domain. And so now instead of sending traffic to YouTube, you’re sending it to your own property, where you can build that direct relationship,” he said.

What’s more, you can let people subscribe to your various offerings, so they know what’s new, but also to give you more direct access to those people who are interested in your company and what you’re doing. The platform also includes an analytics piece, which he sees as a big value proposition for the company, giving customers a deep understanding of their audience and what they’re consuming.

Finally, Kennada, who spent time as CMO at several companies including Gainsight and Hopin, says you have to justify the investment in the media platform to the C-suite. AudiencePlus includes the ability to link to marketing automation and CRM software to see how the content is driving business to the company, which is especially important right now when CIOs are scrutinizing every dollar spent looking for value to the business.

“This is tied to fundamentally to demand generation and revenue. It’s great for brand teams that want to use it…but it’s really principally focused to help companies generate demand in a more efficient way,” he said.

The important thing to remember is that building the infrastructure is one thing, but building an audience to come to that platform is much harder. The company already has a few dozen paying customers using the platform today including Zuora, Five9 and Crossbeam. His early customers are mostly SaaS companies, but this is a product that could potentially be useful for any marketing department looking for new ways to build an audience and have access to a fresh supply of first-party data, something that’s increasingly important with the elimination of cookies on websites.

The company currently has 10 employees with some open recs. He says that he is looking to build a diverse employee base as he scales the company. “It’s super critical and super important. And we have a responsibility as a brand to lead from the front with this,” he said.

Today’s $5.3 million investment was led by Emergence Capital with participation from Forum Ventures, Worklife Ventures, and GTMfund. It also included angel investors from several tech company CEOs including Nick Mehta at Gainsight, his former company,

Making foundation models accessible: The battle between closed and open source AI

Jae Lee is the CEO and co-founder of Twelve Labs, a platform that gives businesses and developers access to multimodal video understanding.

The massive explosion of generative AI models for text and image has been unavoidable lately. As these models become increasingly capable, “foundation model” is a relatively new term being tossed around. So what is a foundation model?

The term remains somewhat vague. Some define it by the number of parameters, and therefore, how large a neural network is, and others by the number of unique and hard tasks that the model can perform. Is making AI models larger and larger and the model’s ability to tackle multiple tasks really that exciting? If you take away all the hype and marketing language, what is truly exciting about these new generations of AI models is this: They fundamentally changed the way we interface with computers and data. Think about companies like Cohere, Covariant, Hebbia and You.com.

We’ve now entered a critical phase of AI where who gets to build and serve these powerful models has become an important discussion point, particularly as ethical issues begin to swirl, like who has a right to what data, whether models violate reasonable assumptions of privacy, whether consent for data usage is a factor, what constitutes “inappropriate behavior” and much more. With questions such as these on the table, it is reasonable to assume that those in control of AI models will perhaps be the most important decision-makers of our time.

Is there a play for open source foundation models?

Because of the ethical issues associated with AI, the call to open source foundation models is gaining momentum. But building foundation models isn’t cheap. They require tens of thousands of state-of-the-art GPUs and many machine learning engineers and scientists. The realm of building foundation models to date has only been accessible by the cloud giants and extremely well-funded startups sitting on a war chest of hundreds of millions of dollars.

Almost all the models and services built by these few self-chosen companies have been closed source. Still, closed source entrusts an awful lot of power and decisions to a limited number of companies that will define our future, which can be quite unsettling.

We’ve entered a critical phase of AI where who gets to build and serve these powerful models has become an important discussion point.

 

The open sourcing of Stable Diffusion by Stability AI, however, posed a serious threat to the foundation model builders determined to keep all the secret sauce to themselves. Cheering from developer communities around the world has been heard regarding Stability’s open sourcing because it liberates systems, putting control in the hands of the masses vs. select companies that could be more interested in profit than what’s good for humanity. This now affects the way insiders think about the current paradigm of closed source AI systems.

Potential hurdles

The biggest obstacle to open sourcing foundation models continues to be money. For open source AI systems to be profitable and sustainable, they still require tens of millions of dollars to be properly run and managed. Though this is a fraction of what the large companies are investing in their efforts, it’s still quite significant to a startup.

We can see Stability AI’s attempt at open sourcing Neo-GPT and turning it into a real business fell flat, as it was outclassed by companies like Open AI and Cohere. Tthe company now has to ideal with the Getty Images lawsuit, which threatens to distract the company and further drain resources — both financial and human. Meta’s counter to closed source systems through LLaMA has poured gas in the open source movement, but it’s still too early to tell if they’ll continue to live up to their commitment.

Study says App Store revenue of small developers grew by 71% in last two years
Ivan Mehta@indianidle / 10:00 PM GMT+9•May 11, 2023

Apple just released findings from an independent study, which highlighted that the revenue of small developers on the App Store grew by 71% from 2020 to 2022. The findings come amid regulatory pressure on Apple to change its app distribution practices, including opening up iOS to other app stores.

The tech giant defines small developers as anyone with less than $1 million in annual earnings from the App Store and less than 1 million downloads across all their apps in a given year. In 2020, the company dropped its fees from 30% to 15% for such developers.

The study said that more than 90% of developers on the App Store were small developers in 2022. Many indie developers joining the ecosystem are based in Europe as 25% of new small developers came from European countries. China represented 23% of developer additions and 14% of new developer signups came from the U.S. Other regions such as South Korea, India, and Brazil contributed 35% in terms of new developers joining the App Store ecosystem.

The report emphasized the reach of the App Store being available in 175 countries. It said that 40% of downloads of apps from small businesses came from outside their home region and 80% of them had their apps on multiple storefronts.

Some developers are growing their revenue at a fast pace, according to today’s study. For instance, 40% of developers who used to be “small developers” — but have graduated from that category as they earned more than $1 million in 2022 — were not on App Store or had less than $10,000 in earnings just five years ago.

With this study, Apple wants to point out that its platform helps small businesses and developers amid regulatory scrutiny. Earlier this year, the company published a report noting that it had paid out $320 billion to developers since the inception of the App Store in 2008.

However, different authorities across the world are looking at Apple’s (and Google’s) monopoly in distributing apps on their respective platform. In February, the Biden administration said that both tech giants are stifling competition through their app stores. It said that these companies have created a “suboptimal” environment for competition and their policies on these stores “have created unnecessary barriers and costs for app developers, ranging from fees for access to functional restrictions that favor some apps over others.”

The company is also reportedly preparing to allow app sideloading on iPhone, largely thanks to the EU’s Digital Market Act (DMA), which will come into effect in 2024.

Meta content review partner Sama told by court to pay moderators

 Comment

Meta’s content moderation partner in Africa Sama was earlier today compelled by a Kenyan court to pay April salaries to a section of moderators it had left out. The direction comes days after moderators picketed at Sama headquarters in Kenya demanding April pay.

The court gave the orders following an urgent application filed on April 27, on behalf of the moderators, seeking to have Sama compelled to pay their salaries, and observe orders issued in March.

About 184 moderators sued Sama for allegedly laying them off unlawfully, after it wound down its content review arm in March, and Majorel, the social media giant’s new partner in Africa, for blacklisting on instruction by Meta.

Today, the judge directed “Sama to continue paying the petitioners being Facebook moderators…and within the terms of the orders given by court.”

The court issued temporary orders on March 21 barring Sama from effecting any form of redundancy, and Meta from engaging Majorel. Majorel was also instructed to refrain from blacklisting ex-Sama moderators.

The court directed Sama to continue reviewing content on Meta’s platforms, and to be its sole provider in Africa pending determination of the case. However, Sama sent the moderators on compulsory leave in April saying it had no work for them as its contract with Meta had expired.

The moderators filed the suit in March alleging that Sama failed to issue redundancy notices, as required by Kenyan law, that the moderators were not issued with a 30-day termination notice, and that their terminal dues were pegged on their signing of non-disclosure documents among other claims. Sama says it observed the Kenyan law, including giving the employees enough notice.

Sama announced in January that it was dropping Meta’s contract and content review services, laying off 260 people in the process, to concentrate on labeling work (computer vision data annotation). This came months after another lawsuit was filed in Kenya by its former content moderator, Daniel Motaung.

Motuang, a South African, had accused Sama and Meta of forced labor and human trafficking, unfair labor relations, union busting and failure to provide “adequate” mental health and psychosocial support. He was allegedly laid off for organizing a 2019 strike and trying to unionize Sama’s employees. Sama and Majorel moderators earlier this week voted to form a union.

As companies explore generative AI more deeply, one of the more confounding issues is the hallucination problem, where if the model doesn’t know the answer, it simply makes one up, whether it makes sense or not. To work in business, finding a way to mitigate this problem is paramount.

Today, Writer, the generative AI writing platform, announced Knowledge Graph in public beta, a tool which enables companies to collect all of the current source content across an organization in a graph database. Company CEO May Habib says that by making use of the customer’s own content, Knowledge Graph can act as a kind of content validator, checking it against the generated content

“The great thing about an LLM is that if it has actual information about what you’re trying to do, it will use that information,” she said. “Knowledge Graph provides the ability to easily get the information that matters — databases, knowledge bases, shared drives, chats — into embeddings so that it can be used by the LLM in service of the very specific use cases our customers build around.”

It will automatically highlight content that needs to be fact-checked, while suggesting a replacement statement based on the most relevant content in the Knowledge Graph when appropriate. And Writer will show its work, displaying the source of the content where the replacement material came from, giving the human employee the ability to accept or reject the suggestion.

The company defines Knowledge Graph as “a structured representation of information stored in graph format, which allows for fast retrieval of specific pieces of information.” It can connect directly to the company’s content sources or customers can manually move content by dragging it dropping it into the Knowledge Graph interface.

It’s a separate repository, so it’s not actually part of the content systems that contribute to the graph. What’s more, companies can host the Knowledge Graph themselves if they wish, or they can let Writer manage it for them.

It’s by no means fool proof because nothing is, but it is a step towards trying to help companies reduce the impact of a known problem. Customers can choose how often they update Knowledge Graph, typically it’s weekly, but it could be more or less often if the customer wants to configure it that way, Habib said. The longer you take between updates, the more content that is not included in the accuracy check.

The company also announced the availability of the ability to self-host the Writer LLM, rather than having Writer do it. Some large organizations may want to more control over the content inside their organization and self hosting provides a higher level of control. The Knowledge Graph can connect to self-hosted LLM, as well.

Both the ability to use an external LLM and the Knowledge Graph are available in open beta starting today. The two products had been in a closed beta prior to this. Writer was founded in 2020, and has raised $26 million to date, per Crunchbase.

Cable wants to help banks cut financial crime through automated assurance
Christine Hall@christinemhall / 9:01 PM GMT+9•May 11, 2023

People in the U.S. reported $8.8 billion of financial fraud in 2022 to the Federal Trade Commission, and while the FTC received fewer reports, 2.4 million versus 2.9 million in 2021, the overall monetary figure is 30% higher than 2021. Bank transfer or payment fraud amounted to $1.6 billion in 2022.

When you expand this globally, Cable’s co-founder Natasha Vernier told TechCrunch that financial crime becomes a $4 trillion problem. And one Vernier, co-founder Katie Savitz and the Cable team have been working on since 2021.

Vernier explained that banks and fintechs need to first have controls in place to mitigate risk. Controls can include Know Your Customer checks, sanctions, screenings, transaction monitoring, all of the offerings that vendors like Unit21 and Alloy do.

About a decade ago, banks were receiving fines by regulators for having “inadequate financial crime controls,” and while the number of those fines dropped off as monitoring vendors came in, some banks are still receiving fines for having “ineffective controls,” Vernier said. That’s because  there is a second requirement that regulated financial institutions have to meet, which is to independently test if their controls actually work.

“So far this has been done entirely manually,” she said. “Banks and fintechs manually sample a tiny percentage of accounts to try and see if those controls are working. That’s what we’ve automated, and we believe we’re the first and only automated solution available at the moment.”

This makes Cable’s platform, which provides automated assurance and risk assessment, complementary to many of the financial crime vendors. It enables banks and fintechs to monitor all of their accounts — not just a fraction as before — to know, in real time, if they are compliant with regulations and if their failure controls are working as expected to combat breaches.

Cable also gives Banking-as-a-Service organizations oversight on the fintech partners they work with — remember, most fintechs don’t have banking licenses and therefore work with banks to offer financial services.

In the past year, the company increased its revenue five times, and since 2021, attracted customers, including Axiom Bank, Quaint Oak Bank and Griffin on the banking side, and fintech and crypto companies, including Tide and Ramp.

“Fintechs have to work with banks to, in essence, borrow their license,” Vernier said. “That’s where we’re finding real traction and one of the areas that the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) is particularly focused on right now: banks that are lending their license to fintechs. They need to understand the effectiveness of the controls at those fintechs, and our product is perfectly suited for that use case.”

Today, Cable announced an $11 million Series A, led by Stage 2 Capital and Jump Capital, with participation from existing investor CRV. The new investment gives the company just over $16 million in total funding.

The capital enables the company to hire across product, engineering, data and go-to-market teams and also accelerate its product development. Vernier said that the company has only built out 1% of the products and features on its two-year roadmap.

Meanwhile, Vernier said as the banking industry moves forward, it will continue to add more ways for consumers to deal with their finances rather than just traditional banks. And with that will be more scrutiny from regulators for improved oversight, which is why she said it is the “perfect time for Cable to raise more money and accelerate.”

“Regulators are particularly interested in effectiveness testing, but also, just the volatility in the banking industry right now, with COVID and if we are in a recession or not, there is increased financial crime,” Vernier said. “We’ve certainly seen, globally, an increase in fraud and other types of financial crime over the last few years. And, as real-time payments get rolled out in the U.S., we’ll see more financial crime.”

Apple’s ATT faces competition probe in Italy

 Comment

Apple is facing another antitrust investigation in Europe over privacy rules it applies to third party apps running on its mobile platform which affect their ability to track iOS users in order to target them with advertising.

Italy’s competition watchdog said today it’s concerned Apple may be creating an unfair advantage for its own ‘personalized’ ads which are not subject to the same permission pop-up it requires for third parties to track iOS users.

Apple launched the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature just over two years ago, requiring third party apps obtain opt-in consent from users to be tracked for ads. The move was decried by the ad industry — and quickly led to a number of complaints being filed with competition authorities. So Italy is by no means the first to probe Apple’s privacy measure.

In a press release today the Italian AGCM announced the launch of an investigation into Apple for alleged abuse of a dominant position in the app market — saying it suspects the company of applying a more “restrictive” privacy policy to app developers than the one it applies to itself. This in turn means third parties are likely to be at a disadvantage when it comes to the “quality and detail” of data made available to them by Apple, it suggested, including relating to the effectiveness of their ad campaigns on iOS.

“This happens due to the technical characteristics of the programming interface they can access — SkAdNetwork — which appears much less effective than Apple Ads Attribution, the tool that Apple adopts for itself,” the AGCM wrote in a statement [NB: this is a machine translation of the original Italian text].

“The availability of data relating to both user profiling and the measurement of the effectiveness of advertising campaigns — while in compliance with privacy protection regulations — are essential elements for the attractiveness of the advertising spaces sold by app developers and purchased by advertisers. For this reason, according to the Authority, Apple’s alleged discriminatory conduct may cause a drop in advertising revenue from third-party advertisers, to the benefit of its commercial division; reduce entry and/or prevent competitors from remaining in the app development and distribution market; benefit their own apps and, consequently, mobile devices and the Apple iOS operating system.”

The AGCM added that it’s concerned Apple’s behavior could reduce incentives to develop innovative apps and create barriers for consumers to switch mobile ecosystems.

Apple was contacted for comment on the AGCM’s investigation.

Since the Apple-imposed iOS limit on third party tracking rolled out a number of studies have also suggested the move lifted Apple’s own ad business and boosted its market power. While ATT has also been credited with blasting a $10BN hole in Facebook-owner Meta’s revenue.

Back in March 2021, soon after launching ATT, Apple was accused of privacy hypocrisy by a French startup lobby group which filed data protection and competition complaints but failed to get the country’s antitrust watchdog to block the feature at that time. Although the French competition authority said it would continue to investigate.

Antitrust watchdogs in Germany and Poland have also announced probes of Apple’s approach since ATT launched. While the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority raised substantial concerns about Apple’s market power generally, in a wide-ranging mobile market ecosystem review towards the end of 2021 (and again in a final report in June 2022). And it has an open investigation into Apple’s App Store following complaints of unfairness by developers.

Back in the EU, antitrust action by the bloc’s competition commission against Apple in recent years has focused on the music streaming market, Apple Pay and in-app payments-related conditions. But one thing to note is that self-preferencing is set to be banned in the region for tech giants designated as so-called Internet “gatekeepers” under a major ex ante competition reform that’s aimed at curbing Big Tech’s market power.

The pan-EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) applies to “core platform services” operated by gatekeepers.

Apple’s App Store is a likely candidate for falling under the DMA regime. If that happens, requirements against self-preferencing and fair dealing with third parties will apply — and could, potentially, affect how it can operate ATT (which is a feature of the App Store).

That said, the bloc’s data protection rulebook (GDPR) also applies so any moves to impose conditions on Apple with the goal of enhancing competition would need to avoid causing privacy harms for consumers in the process, requiring a balance of considerations.

Unlocking the M&A code: 5 factors that can make (or break) a deal

Frank Roe
Contributor
Frank Roe is CEO of SmartBear, a provider of software development and visibility tools. The company has completed eight acquisitions in less than five years.

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have long been a driving force for companies seeking exponential growth, gaining market share and creating shareholder value. History has shown that well-executed M&A strategies can be transformative and yield impressive results.

For instance, Disney’s acquisition of Pixar in 2006 revitalized the animation giant’s fortunes, though market analysts were skeptical of this move when it was announced. In a conversation with CNBC 15 years later, Bob Iger stated it was perhaps the best acquisition decision during his time at Disney. “It put us on the path to achieving what I wanted to achieve, which is scale when it comes to storytelling,” were his exact words.

But the Disney-Pixar marriage isn’t the only one that proved to be a massive growth engine. Facebook’s purchase of Instagram in 2012 allowed the social media behemoth to dominate the photo-sharing space. There are many such examples in the history of businesses around the world.

But all’s not rosy in the world of M&A. It is a complex and substantially risky decision, not for the faint-hearted. It is essential to approach the decision and process with diligence and forethought.

Over the years, with experience navigating the complicated world of M&A, including eight acquisitions in just the past few years, I have built five indispensable elements to consider for a successful mergers and acquisitions journey.

Be watchful of revenue synergies 

One of the critical drivers of a successful acquisition is the ability to achieve revenue synergies. However, what’s more important is not to assume this synergy will automatically occur just because it seems feasible.

Making a decision about consolidated revenue potential after the M&A involves carefully analyzing the potential for growth and gaining clear visibility into how to maximize synergy. Consider acquiring companies with high sales velocity and exponential growth potential to maximize success. Analyze the target’s product offerings, customer base and sales channels to identify cross-selling, upselling and market expansion opportunities.

For instance, in 2015, PayPal acquired Braintree, a payments company that owned the mobile payment service, Venmo. It was a strategic and wise move at a time when digital payments were just taking off across the globe. Now in 2023, PayPal is relying on Venmo to drive the adoption and usage of the company’s digital payments services. The two operations are expected to converge by next year. This acquisition has enabled PayPal to tap into the growing peer-to-peer payments market and strengthen its revenue streams.

Don’t let refactoring throw cold water on your go-to-market strategy

Tech CEOs often make the mistake of assuming that a product will seamlessly integrate into their existing tech stack, especially in a tuck-in acquisition. However, this may not always be the case.

Before making your decision about the acquisition, take the time to evaluate the target company’s go-to-market (GTM) strategy and the ease of finding, buying and deploying their products. Focus on creating a new integrated version in the future to give yourself a longer runway to iron out any issues. This allows customers and employees to see a roadmap for future success.

MediShout wants to bring Amazon-like efficiency to hospital operations
Paul Sawers@psawers / 8:00 PM GMT+9•May 11, 2023
 Comment

The U.K.’s floundering National Health Service (NHS) is not in the best of shapes by just about any estimation, the victim of chronic underfunding and understaffing that has led to excruciatingly long waiting times and health care professionals striking en masse.

But in the midst of chaos, opportunity often lingers. A growing number of startups are capitalizing on the U.K.’s struggling health care system, raising money for platforms that provide access to private medical imaging services, or go some way toward solving staffing shortages.

And then there’s MediShout, a London-based company that proclaims to be a “one stop app” for reporting operational deficiencies in hospitals, allowing staff to track status updates and new orders similar to how one might do with their Uber ride or Amazon order.

Founded by Dr. Ash Kalraiya back in 2013, MediShout unifies all helpdesks and medical suppliers within a single app. It began as a side-project as Kalraiya continued his role as a full-time orthopaedic surgeon, however Kalraiya brought in doctor Ali Bahsoun as co-founder and chief product officer (CPO) in 2020 to kickstart MediShout as a full-time business. The startup went on to raise £167,000 ($211,000) in angel funding, before closing a £1 million ($1.25 million) pre-seed round of funding from Episode 1 in September, 2020.

Kalraiya told TechCrunch that he expects MediShout to be profitable next year, and to spur its next phase of growth it has now raised a further £4.3 million ($5.4 million) in seed funding.

‘Like ordering on Amazon’

Under the hood, MediShout essentially aggregates suppliers, helpdesks, and operational departments, and seeks to supplant incumbent tools such as faxes, emails, paper forms, and helpdesk software (e.g. ServiceNow).

“As a surgeon on the frontline, I witnessed operational problems preventing best patient care daily,” Kalraiya said. “Patient care would routinely be delayed or cancelled due to preventable problems like faulty lightbulbs, broken printers, or missing equipment.”

At a time when health care providers are already under significant pressure, equipment failure is an extra burden they really don’t need. For example, a faulty endoscope can take up to nine hours to fix across multiple different members of staff, due in part to the workflows of multiple department and equipment suppliers. This may involve paperwork, phone calls, and countless logistical measures to arrange delivery and collection of the device. And this is all before we even consider unexpected hurdles and bottlenecks.

“The big issue is not only does staff time get wasted, but often (medical) procedures get cancelled as communication was too slow and devices don’t get returned fast enough,” Kalraiya said.

Kalraiya says that in this instance, MediShout can cut the amount of time in half to around 4.5 hours, with all the reports and updates filed digitally through an app and all relevant stakeholders notified automatically.

“The supplier sends back messages and status updates in real time which all hospital staff can see,” Kalraiya said. “No paperwork is required, and staff don’t have to call their supplier to chase up. This process is now like ordering on Amazon, where everything is digitized and data can be viewed in real time.”

The main problem that MediShout is looking to solve is that hospitals typically use hundreds of different systems from different suppliers, each with very different processes and approaches to communication — this spans facilities, porters, equipment, sterile services, IT, HR, and more.

“This makes healthcare ecosystems extremely complex and difficult for staff to navigate, so they can’t provide efficient care to patients,” Kalraiya said. “We solve this issue by providing the world’s first app which unifies all helpdesks, supplier and operational departments.”

MediShout’s biggest customers are medical device and facilities management companies, which pay MediShout via a monthly subscription to plug into its platform which then digitizes and bridges their services for hospitals, most of which are part of the NHS.

“One supplier is currently scaling us to more than 100 hospitals in the U.K. and abroad,” Kalraiya said. “We do also sell directly to hospitals, in particular the NHS.”

Kalraiya also said that it has some AI work currently in its R&D phase, which — when commercialized — could help predict when future issues may occur. For this, the company can look at, say, all the medical equipment data from hospitals, including details on equipment that has broken over the past 15 years.

“Based on usage and repair frequency we started to predict when equipment like ECG (electrocardiography) machines were likely to break down,” Kalraiya said. “You can then do planned maintenance to prevent breakdowns occurring.”

MediShout, which has 22 employees today, is currently operational in the U.K. and Ireland, though with its fresh cash injection it’s looking to expand further afield into mainland Europe.

“I’ve worked as a surgeon in many countries, and these [operational] problems exist everywhere,” Kalraiya added.

MediShoud’s seed round was led by Nickleby Capital, with participation from KHP Ventures, Episode1, and several individuals from Atomico’s Angels program.

EU lawmakers back transparency and safety rules for generative AI
Committee votes on amendments to the bloc's AI Act also beef up bans on remote biometrics

In a series of votes in the European Parliament this morning MEPs have backed a raft of amendments to the bloc’s draft AI legislation — including agreeing a set of requirements for so called foundational models which underpin generative AI technologies like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The text of the amendment agreed by MEPs in two committees put obligations on providers of foundational models to apply safety checks, data governance measures and risk mitigations prior to putting their models on the market — including obligating them to consider “foreseeable risks to health, safety, fundamental rights, the environment and democracy and the rule of law”.

The amendment also commits foundational model makers to reduce the energy consumption and resource use of their systems and register their systems in an EU database set to be established by the AI Act. While providers of generative AI technologies (such as ChatGPT) are obliged comply with transparency obligations in the regulation (ensuring users are informed the content was machine generated); apply “adequate safeguards” in relation to content their systems generate; and provide a summary of any copyrighted materials used to train their AIs.

In recent weeks MEPs have been focused on ensuring general purpose AI will not escape regulatory requirements, as we reported earlier.

Other key areas of debate for parliamentarians included biometric surveillance — where MEPs also agreed to changes aimed at beefing up protections for fundamental rights.

The lawmakers are working towards agreeing the parliament’s negotiating mandate for the AI Act to unlock the next stage of the EU’s co-legislative process.

MEPs in two committees, the Internal Market Committee and the Civil Liberties Committee, voted on some 3,000 amendments today — adopting a draft mandate on the planned artificial intelligence rulebook with 84 votes in favour, 7 against and 12 abstentions.

“In their amendments to the Commission’s proposal, MEPs aim to ensure that AI systems are overseen by people, are safe, transparent, traceable, non-discriminatory, and environmentally friendly. They also want to have a uniform definition for AI designed to be technology-neutral, so that it can apply to the AI systems of today and tomorrow,” the parliament said in a press release.

Among the key amendments agreed by the committees today are an expansion of the list of prohibited practices — adding bans on “intrusive” and “discriminatory” uses of AI systems such as:

“Real-time” remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces;
“Post” remote biometric identification systems, with the only exception of law enforcement for the prosecution of serious crimes and only after judicial authorization;
Biometric categorisation systems using sensitive characteristics (e.g. gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship status, religion, political orientation);
Predictive policing systems (based on profiling, location or past criminal behaviour);
Emotion recognition systems in law enforcement, border management, workplace, and educational institutions; and
Indiscriminate scraping of biometric data from social media or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases (violating human rights and right to privacy).

The latter, which would outright ban the business model of the controversial US AI company Clearview AI comes a day after France’s data protection watchdog hit the startup with another fine for failing to comply with existing EU laws. So there’s no doubt enforcement of such prohibitions on foreign entities that opt to flout the bloc’s rules will remain a challenge. But the first step is to have hard law.

Commenting after the vote in a statement, co-rapporteur and MEP Dragos Tudorache, added:

Given the profound transformative impact AI will have on our societies and economies, the AI Act is very likely the most important piece of legislation in this mandate. It’s the first piece of legislation of this kind worldwide, which means that the EU can lead the way in making AI human-centric, trustworthy and safe. We have worked to support AI innovation in Europe and to give start-ups, SMEs and industry space to grow and innovate, while protecting fundamental rights, strengthening democratic oversight and ensuring a mature system of AI governance and enforcement.

A plenary vote in parliament to seal the mandate is expected next month (during the 12-15 June session), after which trilogue talks will kick off with the Council toward agreeing a final compromise on the file.

Back in 2021, when the Commission’ presented its draft proposal for the AI Act it suggested the risk-based framework would create a blueprint for “human” and “trustworthy” AI. However concerns were quickly raised that the plan fell far short of the mark — including in areas related to biometric surveillance, with the Commission only proposing a limited ban on use of highly intrusive technology like facial recognition in public.

Civil society groups and EU bodies pressed for amendments to bolster protections for fundamental rights — with the European Data Protection Supervisor and European Data Protection Board among those calling for the legislation to go further and urging EU lawmakers to put a total ban on biometrics surveillance in public.

MEPs appear to have largely heeded civil society’s call. Although concerns do remain. (And of course it remains to be seen how the proposal MEPs have strengthened could get watered back down again as Member States governments enter the negotiations in the coming months.)

Other changes parliamentarians agreed in today’s committee votes include expansions to the regulation’s (fixed) classification of “high-risk” areas — to include harm to people’s health, safety, fundamental rights and the environment.

AI systems used to influence voters in political campaigns and those used in recommender systems by larger social media platforms (with more than 45 million users, aligning with the VLOPs classification in the Digital Services Act), were also put on the high-risk list.

At the same time, though, MEPs backed changes to what counts as high risk — proposing to leave it up to AI developers to decide if their system is significant enough to meet the bar where obligations applying, something digital rights groups are warning (see below) is “a major red flag” for enforcing the rules.

Elsewhere, MEPs backed amendments aimed at boosting citizens’ right to file complaints about AI systems and receive explanations of decisions based on high-risk AI systems that “significantly” impact their rights.

The lack of meaningful redress for individuals affected by harmful AIs was a major loophole raised by civil society groups in a major call for revisions in fall 2021 who pointed out the glaring difference between the Commission’s AI Act proposal and the bloc’s General Data Protection Act, under which individuals can complain to regulators and pursue other forms of redress.

Another change MEPs agree on today is a reformed role for body called the EU AI Office, which they want to monitor how the rulebook is implemented — to supplement decentralized oversight of the regulation at the Member State level.

While, in a nod to the perennial industry cry that too much regulation is harmful for “innovation”, they also added exemptions to rules for research activities and AI components provided under open-source licenses, while noting the law promotes regulatory sandboxes, or controlled environments, being established by public authorities to test AI before its deployment.

Digital rights group EDRi, which has been urging major revisions to the Commission draft, said everything it had been pushing for was passed by MEPs “in some form or another” — flagging particularly the (now) full ban on facial recognition in public; along with (new) bans on predictive policing, emotion recognition and on other harmful uses of AI.

Another key win it points to is the inclusion of accountability and transparency obligations on deployers of high risk AI — applying on them a duty to do a fundamental rights impact assessment and mechanisms by which people affected can challenge AI systems.

“The Parliament is sending a clear message to governments and AI developers with its list of bans, ceding civil society’s demands that some uses of AI are just too harmful to be allowed, Sarah Chander, EDRi senior policy advisor,” told TechCrunch.

“This new text is a vast improvement from the Commission’s original proposal when it comes to reigning in the abuse of sensitive data about our faces, bodies, and identities,” added, Ella Jakubowska, an EDRi senior policy advisor who has focused on biometrics. 

However EDRi said there are still areas of concern — pointing to use of AI for migration control as one big one.

On this, Chander noted that MEPs failed to include in the list of prohibited practices where AI is used to facilitate “illegal pushbacks”, or to profile people in a discriminatory manner — which is something EDRi had called for. “Unfortunately, the [European Parliament’s] support for peoples’ rights stops short of protecting migrants from AI harms, including where AI is used to facilitate pushbacks,” she said, suggesting: “Without these prohibitions the European Parliament is opening the door for a  panopticon at the EU border.”

The group said it would also like to see improvements to the proposed ban on predictive policing — to cover location based predictive policing which Chander described as “essentially a form of automated racial profiling”. She said it’s worried that the proposed remote biometrics identification ban won’t cover the full extent of mass surveillance practices it’s seen being used across Europe.


“Whilst the Parliament’s approach is very comprehensive [on biometrics], there are a few practices that we would like to see even further restricted. Whilst there is a ban on retrospective public facial recognition, it contains an exception for law enforcement use which we still consider to be too risky. In particular, it could incentivise mass retention of CCTV footage and biometric data, which we would clearly oppose,” added Jakubowska, saying it would also want to see the EU outlaw emotion recognition no matter the context — “as this ‘technology’ is fundamentally flawed, unscientific, and discriminatory by design”.

Another concern EDRi flags is MEPs’ proposal to let AI developers judge if their systems are high risk or not — as this risk undermining enforceability.

“Unfortunately, the Parliament is proposing some very worrying changes relating to what counts as ‘high-risk AI. With the changes in the text, developers will be able to decide if their system is ‘significant’ enough to be considered high risk, a major red flag for the enforcement of this legislation,” Chander suggested.

While today’s committee vote is a big step towards setting the parliament’s mandate — and setting the tone for the upcoming trilogue talks with the Council — much could still change and there is likely to be some pushback from Member States governments, which tend to be more focused on national security considerations than caring for fundamental rights.

Asked whether it’s expecting the Council to try to unpick some of the expanded protections against biometric surveillance Jakubowska said: “We can see from the Council’s general approach last year that they want to water down the already insufficient protections in the Commission’s original text. Despite having no credible evidence of effectiveness — and lots of evidence of the harms — we see that many member state governments are keen to retain the ability to conduct biometric mass surveillance.

“They often do this under the pretence of ‘national security’ such as in the case of the French Olympics and Paralympics, and/or as part of broader trends criminalising migration and other minoritised communities. That being said, we saw what could be considered ‘dissenting opinions’ from both Austria and Germany, who both favour stronger protections of biometric data in the AI Act. And we’ve heard rumours that several other countries are willing to make compromises in the direction of the biometrics provisions. This gives us hope that there will be a positive outcome from the trilogues, even though we of course expect a strong push back from several Member States.”

Giving another early assessment from civil society, Kris Shrishak, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), which also joined the 2021 call for major revisions to the AI Act, also cautioned over enforcement challenges — warning that while the parliament has strengthened enforceability by amendments that explicitly allow regulators to perform remote inspections, he suggested MEPs are simultaneously tying regulators hands by preventing them access to source code of AI systems for investigations.

“We are also concerned that we will see a repeat of GDPR-like enforcement problems,” he told TechCrunch.

On the plus side he said MEPs have taken a step towards addressing “the shortcomings” of the Commission’s definition of AI systems — notably with generative AI systems being brought in scope and the application of transparency obligations on them, which he dubbed “a key step towards addressing their harms”.

But — on the issue of copyright and AI training data — Shrishak was critical of the lack of a”firm stand” by MEPs to stop data mining giants from ingesting information for free, including copyright-protected data.

The copyright amendment only requires companies to provide a summary of copyright-protected data used for training — suggesting it will be left up to rights holders to sue.

Asked about possible concerns that exemptions for research activities and AI components provided under open source licenses might create fresh loopholes for AI giants to escape the rules, he agreed that’s a worry.

“Research is a loophole that is carried over from the scope of the regulation. This is likely to be exploited by companies,” he suggested. “In the context of AI it is a big loophole considering large parts of the research is taking place in companies. We already see Google saying they are ‘experimenting’ with Bard. Further to this, I expect some companies to claim that they develop AI components and not AI systems (I already heard this from one large corporation during discussions on General purpose AI. This was one of their arguments for why GPAI [general purpose AI] should not be regulated).”

Canon sidles up to vloggers with PowerShot V10
Who says compact cameras are dead?
Haje Jan Kamps@Haje / 6:50 PM GMT+9•May 11, 2023
 Comment

Who says compact cameras are dead? Well, the market does, actually; the mobile phone has all but killed off the category altogether, so it’s interesting to see Canon take another stab at the market. The PowerShot series of cameras today gained its newest family member, the V10.

The main question this product has to overcome is ‘why not just use your phone,’ and the camera nerd in me is relieved to have a good answer: Phone cameras are great, but they have to be small. With that restriction removed, Canon can do what Canon does best: Build cameras. On paper, the little camera looks great; it is built around a 1-inch CMOS sensor. That alone is a big deal; phone cameras are getting good enough now that we are right at the edge of what physics can do for us: Sensors get hot, and with all those pixels packed into a tiny space, and limitations on how good and precise lenses can be, you’re butting up against the practical maximum image quality you can get.

If you want to get better from there, you need to add smarts (i.e. image processing enhancements, which is increasingly AI-powered), or shift to bigger sensors. Canon’s Powershot V10 treats us to both: it has 14 built-in color filters and ‘Smooth Skin’ mode to help you look your best.

The sturdy vertical body is an entirely new design for Canon – and it makes a lot of sense in a world where these cameras are more likely to be placed somewhere to film yourself, than hand-held and shooting. Which is an additional point: Smartphone cameras are getting great, but a lot of this kind of content is filmed with the selfie camera, which is often lower resolution and quality than the rear-facing cameras. Canon’s V10 resolves that by making the screen flippable, and you get the best of both worlds: Full-quality camera and a preview to frame your shot.

Canon’s newest helps make it possible to shoot in both vertical and horizontal orientations, matching the various social media platforms. If you’re wanting to use the camera as a webcam, streaming cam, or content production cam, it has you covered, whether you’re shooting for YouTube, TikTok, or – a favorite among home chefs – OnlyPans. Whatever else the cool kids are doing with their video, Canon hopes it can win folks over. 

The camera includes two high-quality stereo microphones, and a third microphone added to aid noise reduction. It also connects with the Canon Camera Connect app to transfer videos over Wi-Fi (no more messing about with memory cards!) and the camera has USB ports to easily transfer to a computer at higher speeds, or to be used as a web cam.

The V10’s adjustable stand means you don’t have a lug a tripod with you everywhere. Neat! Image Credit: Canon

For those on the go, the camera charges over USB-C, which is a nice perk, and it has a built-in stand that makes it easy to tilt the camera up to 30 degrees. Genius; it’s as if camera manufacturers finally realized that not everybody is as excited as I am to buy tripods in all weights and sizes.

The Canon PowerShot V10 can be purchased as part of two different bundles. The standard kit includes a power cable, soft case, lens cap, windshield and wrist strap. For those who want more creative options, an advanced kit includes a cage that can be used to attach additional lighting options or hold an external microphones etc.

Starting at $429, the camera is well-priced to be positioned as cheaper and better than a smartphone and a stepping stone on the way up to a full-size interchangeable lens camera.

Canon produced a video to show how it all works, along with some sample footage from the camera:

Twitter launches encrypted DMs for verified users with security drawbacks
Ivan Mehta@indianidle / 6:34 PM GMT+9•May 11, 2023

After talking about it for months, Twitter has finally released its first version of encrypted DMs — but there are a few limitations. Currently, this feature is only available to verified users (such as Blue subscribers) or accounts associated with verified organizations. Additionally, the encryption feature isn’t compatible with group messages and Twitter doesn’t offer protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.

Twitter said that while encryption works across platforms, the recipient has to follow the sender to enable it. Alternatively, encryption can be enabled if a user has chatted with the sender before, or accepted their DM request. If users are eligible for an encrypted conversation, the sender will get an option to turn on encryption through a toggle on the new chat screen.

Image Credits: Twitter

To turn on encryption for an existing conversation, you can tap on the information icon in the corner of the conversation screen and tap on the option that says “Start an encrypted message”. Encrypted conversations will look different from normal conversation as Twitter places a lock badge on the recipient’s profile picture. In the conversation itself, the company will show a “Messages are encrypted” banner at the top.

Image Credits: Twitter

The social network makes it clear in its blog post that there are several limitations to this implementation. On the conversational level, Twitter just supports encryption for one-to-one messages with text and links. Twitter said that media is currently not supported in encrypted conversations.

Additionally, people can’t use a new device to join an existing encrypted conversation. So you either have to use the same device with which you initiated an encrypted conversation or start a new conversation when you get a new device. Users can only use 10 devices in total to use the encryption feature, and there is no way to deregister a device to make room for a new one.

Notably, Twitter considers reinstalling the app as registering a new device. Twitter doesn’t offer a key backup option, which means that all your encrypted messages on that device will be wiped out if you log out of the account.

But the complex part is that Twitter doesn’t delete private keys from the device on logout — only messages. Users will be able to fetch existing conversations if they log in again from the same device. The company cautioned that people shouldn’t use the encryption feature on shared devices because of this limitation. This could change when Twitter starts offering a key backup option.

There are plenty of doubts about the feature’s security offering, too. It’s not clear what cryptographic standard Twitter is using for this feature. The company just said it is deploying “a combination of strong cryptographic schemes” in its blog post talking about the encryption feature.

*Properly implemented* End to end encrypted messaging = good.

But trustworthy & safe deployment = hard.

Rolling your own crypto = recipe for trouble.

Transparency is key.

Many questions: did Twitter roll their own? Is this somebody else's protocol? Has it been audited? pic.twitter.com/kqUTpL038v

— John Scott-Railton (@jsrailton) May 10, 2023

Twitter said that its encryption feature also doesn’t offer forward secrecy protection, so an attacker can access all of a user’s past conversations if they get access to a compromised device. The company said it decided not to implement this feature to let users access their unencrypted DMs on any device.

At the moment, Twitter doesn’t offer signature checks or message verification features. So devices themselves can’t check the authenticity of the message and people can’t use methods like comparing number strings to verify encryption protection.

This makes the system vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. That means an attacker can read your messages if the security is compromised. Twitter also hinted that it could give this conversation up to authorities as part of a legal process due to the current design flaws.

“As a result, if someone — for example, a malicious insider, or Twitter itself as a result of a compulsory legal process — were to compromise an encrypted conversation, neither the sender nor receiver would know,” the company said. Twitter wants to add signature checks and safety numbers so that these attacks or requests are no longer possible.

After taking over the company, Elon Musk has expressed his desire to “superset Signal” with Twitter DMs. However, with the current set of limitations, it doesn’t offer the same level of protection that Signal or other apps offer. Both Signal and WhatsApp offer end-to-end encryption for all kinds of conversations. Additionally, Signal doesn’t log any metadata about contacts or messages.

“As Elon Musk said, when it comes to Direct Messages, the standard should be, if someone puts a gun to our heads, we still can’t access your messages. We’re not quite there yet, but we’re working on it,” the company said.

Fairphone gets its audio groove on with repairable over-ear BT headphones
Natasha Lomas@riptari / 6:00 PM GMT+9•May 11, 2023
 Comment

Dutch social enterprise Fairphone is best known for its mission to build ethical smartphones via a brand that promises fairer wages for supply chain workers and design choices that encourage consumers to cherish and repair the hardware rather than toss last year’s model thanks to modularity and a web shop selling replacement (and upgradeable) spare parts.

Today it’s taking the leap into a new device category — applying the same principled approach to shipping the most sustainable and fair consumer electronics it can, within limits imposed by wider industry practices which set the availability (and compatibility) of electronics components, to a pair of its own-design, over-ear Bluetooth headphones. The latest repairable Fairphone product is called Fairbuds XL.

Confusingly, Fairbuds XL are very much not (in-ear) earbuds. So the choice of name is evidently a bit of a pun. Fairphone tells TechCrunch there was hot debate internally over what to call the headphones. We can only imagine what other options were toyed with and rejected. But, clearly, naming a pair of over-ear headphones “buds” will cause some to howl in disbelief. Still, at least they sidestepped the obvious (yet alluring) pitfall of calling the cans Fairphones (see what we did there!). The final name choice was favored for being “unique”, as they tell it.

The Fairbuds XL are available to buy through Fairphone’s website (and select retailers) from today — retailing for €249 in the EU. (As with the company’s smartphones they’re mostly only shipping to Europe at present so US readers are out of luck, or else will have to find their own creative shipping solution.)

The repairable headphones come in a choice of two colors: Speckled black (pictured above); or speckled green with some snazzy orange detailing (shown in non-exploded view below):

Fairphone is remaining tight lipped on projections of how many pairs of headphones it expects to ship. And clearly it’s taking a bit of a leap here.

That said, fans of the company may have noticed it does already sell a pair of wireless earbuds (with the more vanilla name of “True Wireless Stereo Earbuds“), so it has been dabbling in the audio accessory space for a while. However Fairbuds XL represent a new category for the device maker, according to Fairphone’s head of product management, Miquel Ballester, and audio product manager, Bob van Iersel, a more recent addition to the team. This is because — unlike with the (actually) earbuds it sells — they’re not working with off-the-shelf components for the over-ear ‘phones. Rather they’ve designed this new audio product from scratch themselves. And designed the headphones to be easily dissembled for repairability.

As with Fairphone’s eponymous (screwdriver-friendly) smartphones, Fairbuds XL are comprised of modular parts that connect up to support ease of repair and promote function longevity — furthering the core mission of shipping more sustainable electronics (vs the built-in-obsolescence industry modus operandi that quickly leads to heaps of environmentally unfriendly e-waste).

“The level of modularity is similar or even more than the phones,” says Ballester, discussing Fairbuds XL in an interview with TechCrunch. “All the [replaceable] parts will be available on the website. And [there are] more specific components that we’ve also designed to be easy to replace — those specific small parts we will not be offering at the beginning on our website. Later, based on need, and what we see on the market, we might want to make all these other parts available.”

“The headphones are built up out of nine modules slash spare parts,” continues van Iersel. “Some of these parts are really relatively simple mechanical parts. Think about the ear cushions, the headband, the hinges. And there are also more complex parts — like the right speaker module which also has the buttons, the Bluetooth chipset and whatnot. So that’s the more comprehensive spare part.

“But in theory, all of them are replaceable. So there is not one single part that defines what the base of the headphones is, let’s say. So even if your Bluetooth module breaks down for whatever reason it’s not the case that you can’t use all the other ones — it’s easy to simply order replacement parts for that and the rest of the headphones will work as they are supposed to.”

“With this product, we truly design it from the ground up,” van Iersel also tells us. “That’s reflected in the modularity, the repairability of the design… With the headphones we saw an opportunity to enter a market which could could benefit a lot from the Fairphone approach — with making products that are more repairable, more durable and really designed to last a long time. That’s that’s what we set out to do with these headphones and what we think that we achieved as well.”

“For us, the headphones is a way to bring to the market what we do in the supply chain in the design of our products,” rejoins Ballester. “So this is kind of a proof that it can be done. And — for me — we are closing a gap in the market… There are no other companies doing, in this case headphones, as an artefact for changing the industry.”

Other elements that check Fairphone’s core ethical electronics mission are a “living wage” pledge applied to the headphone’s suppliers to encourage them to provide fairer working conditions for workers in their factories. There’s also fairtrade gold integrated into the Fairbuds supply chain. While recycled materials make up over 80% of the plastic weight of the headphones — with 100% recycled aluminium in structural parts, too.

Some non-recycled plastic has been used in areas where acoustic considerations are more sensitive, per van Iersel. So there’s an element of Fairphone needing to balance core product performance against sustainability targets. But Ballester says they’ll continue seeking to push the boundaries of what’s possible on the recycled materials front.

Designing such a bespoke audiophile product necessitated Fairphone bringing audio expertise in-house (to supplement its existing mobile hardware smarts). They also worked with partners on tuning the audio — touting a “signature sound” for the Fairbuds XL, as van Iersel puts it. On the audio performance side, he expresses confidence that the sound quality is reflective of what consumers can expect for over-ear headphones retailing at this price-point. (Cheaper Beats cans are in the same sort of price range, for example.)

“Fairphone did not originally have the audio expertise in house to build these kinds of projects so we made sure to partner up really well — with both hardware suppliers as well as on the software side. We have partnered to ensure the great sound quality that we managed to achieve in the end. Because, with this product, we didn’t want to just offer a ‘fair’ version of what headphones could be; but they should also be able to carry their weight when it comes to sound quality,” he tells TechCrunch.

“On the hardware side, there are different things that make up for the sound quality. It’s not only the components that you put in but also how you put them in. So we’ve chosen a chipset that supports… a high fidelity audio codec to make sure whenever you throw at it from your phone it gets processed in a Hi-Fi definition. And next to that we use 40 millimetre dynamic drivers, which is comparable to what anything in this category would have. But also, we made sure not just to select the right drivers but also to have our partner carefully design the acoustic chamber in which they are placed inside the headphones themselves — because that’s massively affects the final sound as well.”

Other sound quality considerations van Iersel says the Fairbuds’ designers have paid attention to include the clamping force of the headphones and the material for the ear cushions to ensure a proper seal. As noted above, it also worked with a third party audio calibration partner, called Sonarworks, to tune the sound.

“We developed a custom Fairphone sound signature that is part of these headphones. And it’s even something that we could carry on over to future audio products as well,” says van Iersel, noting Sonarworks created a selection of audio pre-sets Fairbuds’ users can choose from in a companion app which is launching with the headphones (both for iOS and Android).

“We also intend to reach different or new target audience with this,” he adds. “Because with the phone there’s obviously a huge threshold for consumers to switch brands, to go for something that they don’t know yet. But we do have a lot of fans of Fairphone that like our mission and would be happy to support it but aren’t willing to take that leap to buy a smartphone. But this could be a much more like the entry level Fairphone [product].

“That’s also why we chose to develop the application not just for Androids but also for iOS. So we’re not just targeting current Fairphone customers… It’s really a product that’s meant to compete with all other headphones — and not just be seen as a Fairphone accessory because that’s absolutely not what it is.”

The need to build up the necessary expertise in new product category goes some way to explaining why it took Fairphone a (fair) bit longer than it had originally expected to get the Fairbuds XL to market (circa four months). But, well, hardware is hard and its repairable Bluetooth headphones are juggling both swappable mechanical (moving) parts and higher tech chipsets, as well as shipping with the aforementioned companion apps to let users custom-tune the sound. So there’s perhaps more work involved in Fairphone delivering decent modular cans than you might consider at first glance.

A range of spare parts are available to buy for the Fairbuds XL on its web shop from launch — such as new ear cap covers for a few Euros or a new battery for around €20. Consumers of the product get a two year warranty on purchase, so any component breakages in that time are likely to be covered by Fairphone (well, unless you damage the product by sitting on it or something).

Given Fairphone offers a five year warranty on its new smartphones, a two year warranty for Fairbuds XL may seem a little low ball for a brand that centers sustainability. And Ballester admits they had wanted to be able to offer the same five year pledge. But he says uncertainties attached to shipping a device in a new category, and specifically needing to see how the headphones stand up to real world daily use/abuse, led them to opt for the less risky choice of a shorter warranty at launch. He adds that they hope to be able to extend it in the future as they see how the Fairbuds perform in the wild.

One neat longevity feature he highlights is the product has been designed so it can always function as wired headphones — meaning that, even many years hence, when it might finally be impossible to get a replacement battery for this particular Fairbuds model (even from Fairphone’s own web shop), the headphones will still function without a battery by plugging them in — at least assuming there’s a USB-C socket to hand. (Regionally at least, that’s a fairly safe bet since EU lawmakers are pushing for USB-Type C to be the charging standard for consumer electronics.)

Talking of supportive policymaking, the EU is working on right to repair legislation that looks set to give Fairphone’s approach considerable regional uplift in the years to come. And Ballester welcomes the planned expansions to EU ecodesign legislation. Discussing this, he also suggests lawmakers could go further, too — flagging the need for them to pay greater attention to consumer electronics business models and find more ways to support models that aim to sell consumers on sustainability, rather than sticking with the dirty old gadget-makers’ game of driving resource-hungry hardware upgrade cycles.

In Fairphone’s home market of the Netherlands, it’s now offering a smartphone subscription service, called Fairphone Easy, that lets users rent its handsets for a flat monthly fee which covers the cost of any necessary repairs and/or replacement. When the lease expires or the device breaks the handsets are returned to the company for reuse (refurbishment) or else for recycling components at end of their useful life to maximize resource utilization and minimize e-waste.

“I think it’s two models that will have to coexist,” suggests Ballester, tracking where sustainable consumer electronics may be headed in the years to come. “You will have the type of consumers that are more convenience driven. Like ‘I am very sustainably minded but I don’t need to repair a product myself.’ [Who] will buy into a service proposition because [they] don’t get the burden of ownership. And that’s totally fair. And there will be a type of consumers that will be fine with that burden of ownership because they know they need to recycle at the end of life. They need to keep their device as long as possible. They know that they need to repair.

“So for me these two models will coexist in the future. And we’ll have to divert more convenience-driven consumers to our service propositions… And I think companies should be smart enough to create the business models that really unlock sustainability for any type of consumer. And I think service propositions have a role there.”

Microsoft makes strategic investment into Builder.ai, integrates its services into Teams
Mike Butcher@mikebutcher / 5:00 PM GMT+9•May 11, 2023
 Comment

Builder.ai tapped into a new wave of businesses wanting their own native apps with a turnkey approach, accelerated by the rapid digitization of life during the pandemic. That led to led to a $100 million Series C funding round last year led by Insight Partners, taking the company’s total funding to $195 million.

It’s now landed a strategic collaboration with Microsoft, which includes an undisclosed equity investment in the startup. TechCrunch’s source’s indicate the investment was “significant”, though we couldn’t get anything more than that.

The collaboration will mean the two companies collaborating on AI solutions. Builder’s “Natasha” AI will be available to users of Teams, and made available when they are looking to build apps and software. Microsoft’s Q2 results showed Teams has hit more than 280 million monthly active users.

Builder.ai’s CEO Sachin Dev Duggal said in a statement: “From my first meeting with Microsoft to the moment we agreed to collaborate more strategically, one thing has been really clear-Microsoft’s commitment to helping everyone unlock their true potential.”

There will also be integrations across Azure OpenAI Service and other Azure Cognitive Services with Builder.ai’s software assembly line and adoption of the Microsoft Cloud and AI, alongside partnerships across the Microsoft Developer Platforms.

“We see Builder.ai creating an entirely new category that empowers everyone to be a developer and our new, deeper collaboration fuelled by Azure AI will bring the combined power of both companies to businesses around the world,” added Jon Tinter, Corporate Vice President, Business Development, Microsoft.

This year’s Google IO was all about AI. The company announced a number of AI-powered features across its products on Wednesday. The search giant also launched a new page called Google Labs to let people sign up for these experiments and test out AI-powered features for feedback before the wider release.

Currently, you can look at four projects on the Google Labs home page. AI-powered Google search features; AI in Google Workspaces; Tailwind, which is the company’s new project about smarter note-taking; and MusicLM, a new tool that lets you generate music through text prompts. You can learn more about each project or sign up for the waitlist to try them out.

Google said that it will soon roll out some limited-time experiments. These will include search enhancements under Search Generative Experience (SGE), which will help people give a summary of search topics and prompts to explore more about them; Code Tips, which will give help users with coding problems directly from the search bar for languages like Java, Go, Python, Javascript, C++, Kotlin, shell, Docker and Git; and “Add to Sheets,” which will let you embed search results like vacation suggestion directly into a Google Sheet.

At the moment, search labs are available in only US and in English. Plus, most experiments require users to be 18 and above to join the waitlist. Google Labs is available to access through the website or via the Labs icon on the Google app.

Apart from opening a new Labs page for AI experiments, Google also lifted the waitlist on the Bard chatbot and made it available to users in 180 countries along with support for Japanese and Korean.

SoftBank Vision Fund yearly loss widens to $32B on startups valuation cut

SoftBank Vision Fund lost $32 billion in the financial year ending March as the Japanese investment giant, the most prolific global investor in tech startups, continues to suffer from valuation corrections across its portfolio of private and public tech companies amid a weakening global economy.

The loss surged about 70% from the same period a year prior, when SoftBank had reported $19 billion in losses at the Vision Fund unit. The losses come even as SoftBank has grown very cautious about deploying new capital to startups in recent quarters.

Among the losses, the Japanese conglomerate said its Vision Fund 1 made an unrealized loss of $1.6 billion each in SenseTime Group and GoTo and nearly $800 million in DoorDash.

The fair value of SoftBank’s portfolio was marked down over the quarter by $2.3 billion to $138 billion.

“For private portfolio companies, the fair value decreased in a wide range of investments, mainly reflecting markdowns of weaker-performing companies and share price declines among market comparable companies,” SoftBank Group said in earnings report Thursday.

SoftBank chief finance officer Yoshimitsu Goto said earlier this year that the firm had entered “defence mode” and was preparing for three different scenarios. SoftBank anticipates that the market may either start to show recovery linearly this year, or by second half of this year, or in a worst-case scenario stumble through until early 2024.

The tumultuous times at SoftBank Vision Fund means a tough time for many of its portfolio startups, many of whom themselves are loss-making. SoftBank has served as a high-conviction growth investor for its portfolio startups, often leading or co-leading later, and often large, financing rounds.

It’s logical that SoftBank is now going to be considerably more selective and judicious about investing going forward. The firm closed 25 deals in the last 12 months, and did an investment of about $400 million in the quarter ending March — but compare that to over 40 in its heyday in 2018 with total invested reaching well into the billions, sometimes even for single startups like WeWork and Grab.

In the meantime, it is attempting to paint a picture of stability across its existing portfolio, estimating that 94% of the companies across all funds currently have a cash runway of more than 12 months.

SoftBank Vision Fund and Tiger Global escalated the pace of their dealmaking in 2021 as many investors believed that the rally in public stock markets would continue for the foreseeable future. But a sharp decline in the markets — accentuated by the Fed increasing interest rates and the unfolding of geopolitical events such as Russia invading Ukraine — has left many tech companies exposed with drops in business and shadows over their earnings forecasts, devaluing the businesses themselves, and leaving many investors scrambling to find ways to cut losses.

Invesco has cut the valuation of Swiggy in its holdings to $5.5 billion, just a year after leading a financing round in the Indian food delivery startup that valued the firm at $10.7 billion. Ola, the leading ride-hailing giant service in India, saw its valuation slashed by Vanguard to below the startup’s 2019 value. Both the startups are SoftBank Vision Fund’s star portfolio firms in India.

On a more positive note, SoftBank Group said the initial public offering of Arm was progressing “smoothly.” If and when it goes ahead, it could be a milestone that could generate considerable returns for the Japanese conglomerate. ARM’s $40 billion sale to Nvidia, first announced in 2020, was ultimately scuppered by regulators; now reports estimate that it could fetch a market cap of between $30 billion and $80 billion, although the IPO window has been shut for some time now, and tech stocks have been floundering.

SoftBank Group also estimated that 94% of its startup holdings maintain a financial runway of no less than 12 months.

The firm did not offer an update on whether it’s kickstarting the process to raise money for Vision Fund 3. It has said in the past that it will consider raising Vision Fund 3 after it has exhausted deploying the Vision Fund 2’s capital.

Everseen raises over $70M for AI tech to spot potential retail theft

In 2007, Alan O’Herlihy, who previously worked with large SAP installations as well as retail, set out to find a way to help retailers minimize “shrinkage,” or where a store has fewer items in stock than in its recorded inventory. He settled on computer vision as the solution to the problem, and founded a company, Everseen, to commercialize the technology.

Everseen — which uses computer vision to, among other things, attempt to prevent theft at self-checkout counters — today announced that it raised €65 million (~$71.32 million) in a Series A round led by Crosspoint Capital Partners, a previous investor in the startup. The new funds bring Ireland-based Everseen’s total raised to nearly $90 million, which O’Herlihy says is being put toward scaling the startup’s business with a “targeted” roadmap.

“We’re experiencing significant demand for our technology from retailers grappling with the dual impact of declining customer spending and rising operational losses, including shrinkage,” O’Herlihy said. “The retail industry is also facing challenges such as labor shortages and labor cost inflation, making our technology even more valuable in addressing these issues.”

Shrinkage in particular can be a serious hit to retailers’ bottom lines, to O’Herlihy’s point. In 2017, stores lost an estimated 1.33% of revenues to shrinkage, totaling an estimated $47 billion, according to the National Retail Federation.

Everseen uses a combination of ceiling-mounted cameras and computer vision software to — in theory  — reduce theft at the point of sale in brick-and-mortar stores. According to O’Herlihy, Everseen’s algorithms can detect and track objects (e.g. SKUs) of interest, analyzing how they interact and recognizing “actions of interest” performed by shoppers and sales associates.

Beyond theft, Everseen claims to be able “know” when items on a shelf are almost out of stock and “pinpoint processes needing immediate attention to help staff solve issues, improve trends and reduce variances.” The platform, which processes video of hundreds of millions of products and tens of millions of customer interactions every day, can connect with a retailer’s existing tools such as an order management system to provide insights and near-real time analytics.

“All of these elements serve as input, allowing our solution to ‘nudge’ a customer to self-correct or instruct a store associate to engage and aid the customer in question,” O’Herlihy explained. “Our goal is to stop and recover loss, enable the retailer to intervene, promote great customer interactions and create fluid processes while improving the overall customer experience and positively impacting the bottom line.”

Everseen hasn’t always succeeded in this mission. Workers at Walmart, which was once a major Everseen customer, told Wired in a 2020 that the system often misidentified innacous behavior as theft and failed to stop actual instances of stealing.

In response to the allegations, Walmart said that it made “significant improvements” to its Everseen system that resulted in fewer alerts overall. But the relationship between the two companies deteriorated soon after. Everseen sued Walmart, claiming the retailer had misappropriated the Irish firm’s technology and then built its own product similar to Everseen’s. (Everseen and Walmart settled in December 2021.)

Everseen’s tech monitoring for anomalies.

It’s tough to gauge the accuracy of any system without access to its backend. But history has taught us that computer vision tech — especially tech designed for anti-shoplifting purposes — is susceptible to bias and other flaws.

Consider an algorithm trained to spot “suspicious” activity from a shopper. If the data set used to train it was imbalanced — say, contained an overwhelming amount of footage of Black shoppers stealing — it’d likely flag the overrepresented shoppers more often than others.

Some AI-powered anti-theft solutions, moreover, are explicitly designed to detect shoplifting track gait — patterns of limb movements — among other physical characteristics. It’s a potentially problematic approach considering that disabled shoppers, among others, might have gaits that appear suspicious to an algorithm trained on video of able-bodied shoppers.

But assuming for a moment that Everseen is largely bias-free, there’s still the elephant in the room with every camera-based tracking system: privacy. In an email exchange, Crosspoint’s Greg Clark mentioned using Everseen’s tech to possibly capture purchasing intent and behavior to “market to specific demographics,” a touchy prospect, to be sure.

I asked O’Herlihy about how it treats customer data, including any footage it records of shoppers and store associates. He said that Everseen defers to customers on data retention policies and — for what it’s worth — is “fully compliant” with GDPR.

Whether shoppers — or associates, for that matter — implicitly trust Everseen is another question. But the potentially thorny ethical issues don’t appear to be dissuading customers from signing up for the startup’s services.

O’Herlihy claims that Everseen counts over half of the world’s top 15 retailers among its customers, with deployments in over 6,000 retail stores and at more than 80,000 checkout lines.

“The speed of adoption of this transformational technology increased during the pandemic as retailers looked for different ways to sell and shoppers looked for different ways to buy,” O’Herlihy said. “In terms of tech spend, we have seen a reallocation of budgets as the challenges for retailers are evolving with tackling shrink being viewed as a top priority in the industry … Everseen is squarely aligned with current trends.”

In a general sense, it’s true that retailers are embracing — or at least showing an interest in — AI. A recent KPMG survey found that 90% of retail business leaders believe their employees are prepared and have the skills for AI adoption, while 53% agree that the pandemic increased their company’s pace of adoption.

In the future, Everseen — no doubt under pressure from rivals like AI Guardsman and VaakEye — plans to broaden its tech to sectors besides retail, like supply chain and manufacturing. The startup currently has around 1,000 employees across its headquarters in Cork as well as hubs in the U.S., Barcelona, India and Australia and elsewhere.

“Starting with retail allowed Everseen to develop both a foundation and library of computer vision AI use cases that are relevant for other adjacent industries,” O’Herlihy said. “Computer vision solutions are currently very siloed and targeted at solving specific problems. We are seeing increased demand for our platform as customers are seeking to solve other problems across the retail store estate.”
